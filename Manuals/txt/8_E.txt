The air bag is designed to complement the action of the seat belt. Both the air bags and seat belts are integral parts of the same protection system. It is therefore essential to wear seat belts at all times. If seat belts are not worn the occu pants are exposed to the risk of serious injury in the event of an accident. It may also increase the risk of minor super ficial injuries occurring when the air bag is deployed although such minor injuries are always possible with air bags. If the vehicle should overturn or suffer a rear impact however severe the pretensioners and air bags are not always triggered. Shocks to the underbody of the vehicle e.g. from pavements potholes or stones can all trigger these systems.
